# object-level semantic slam 
### The system is capable of localizing and constructing semantic maps of objects represented as ellipsoids in dynamic environments

### this system is built upon [ORB-SLAM2](git@github.com:raulmur/ORB_SLAM2.git), and the semantic mapping module is a reimplementation of [oa-slam](https://gitlab.inria.fr/tangram/oa-slam), i rewrite this part of code and add new algorithms to make it work in dynamic environments.

### thanks to the [ORB-SLAM2](git@github.com:raulmur/ORB_SLAM2.git) and [oa-slam](https://gitlab.inria.fr/tangram/oa-slam)

## Run the TUM RGB-D dataset 
### use the detect scripts in the yolo folder to get the detection result, then change the scripts in the Examples/RGB-D folder according to the path of the detection results and the dataset
